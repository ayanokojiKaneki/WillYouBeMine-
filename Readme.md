# Fun Date Proposal Project

This is a fun project that simulates a date proposal with interactive buttons and dynamic UI changes based on user responses. The project consists of a message asking the user if they want to go out on a date, along with two buttons for responding "Yes" or "No". The project also uses local storage to remember the user's response even after reloading the page.

## Features

- Display a message asking "wanna go out on date with me?" along with two buttons for responding.
- Dynamic UI changes:
  - If the user clicks "No", the size of the "Yes" button increases, and the text on the "No" button changes to a random phrase.
  - If the user clicks "Yes", it displays an "Ok yay" screen.
- Local storage: The user's response is stored in local storage, so even if the page is reloaded, the response is remembered.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Read the message and choose your response by clicking on the "Yes" or "No" button.
4. Observe the dynamic UI changes based on your response.
5. Reload the page and notice that your response is remembered.
